<h2>Favorite Movies of all Time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>#1: Megamind</h3>
<p>Smart, interesting villain turns hero not because he was convinced his evilness was evil, but because his goals aligned with that of the city</p>
<h3>#2: Big Lebowski</h3>
<p>Big wtf movie</p>
<h3>#3: The Circle</h3>
<p>I love movies that are psycological experiencies between characters within an enclosed area</p>
